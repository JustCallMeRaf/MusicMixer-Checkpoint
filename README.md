"Sprint 1: Setup, analysis and initial design

Set up the Github repo with a readme (make sure this is more than just the project name - refer to readme examples online). BOTH team members should be contributing at this point - the designer can create the layout, generate the html and the css; the developer should be researching functionality, creating JavaScript files, updating the HTML to add classes or other tools you might need to make things work. Testing events, loading audio, etc can all happen here - it doesn’t have to be final/finished but you should have an idea of how you want things to work, how you want it to look and start designing, testing and experimenting.

IMPORTANT - designers MUST contribute to the repository directly, on their own design branch. You MAY NOT deliver design work via social media, or your partner’s commits, or deviate from the workflow best practices in any way. Create your artwork, add and commit it via Github. Failure to follow the correct workflow as outlined in the Authoring class will result in a (substantial) grade reduction.

Sprint 2: Drag and drop, audio, design improvements

Implement drag and drop functionality; get your audio synced and playback working. Designers should be replacing any FPO (for position only) assets with real artwork and doing any other design changes that need to be finished.

Sprint 3: Final touches / improvements

At this point you should be crushing any final bugs that pop up, doing any final design tweaks, and lots of testing / fixing. Responsive fixes would occur here as well - make sure you’re testing on lots of different screen sizes."
